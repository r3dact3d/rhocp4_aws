### GitHub Secrets
 **CONTAINER_AUTHORITIES** - This is found in __worker.ign__
 **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**
 **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**

**params.json**
This is the parameters file that passes customizable params to the parent stack infra.yml

**infra.yml**
This is in root directory and is the parent stack, it holds some parameters that can be modified that aren't in the parameters file.

**cf-modules**
This directory holds the Cloudformation templates that create the different nested stacks that are called by infra.yml


### GitHub Actions
**validate.aml**


#### TODO
* Add step in pipeline to put cf-modules in s3 bucket - needs to read DevopsBucket from params
